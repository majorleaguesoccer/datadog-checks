datadog-checks
==============

We have been using [Datadog](http://www.datadoghq.com) to monitor our applications and infrastructure at Major League Soccer Digital for several months now. We are huge fans of the product and we have found ourselves integrating it with more of our stack. 

Where possible, we contribute our integration checks back, but some checks are too specialized for inclusion in the datadog agent core. This repository is for those checks. Feel free to use them as they are or as starting points for your own checks. We gladly accept pull requests!

Available checks:

- [Open file handles](/open_handles)
